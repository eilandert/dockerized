#
# aptly-queue-worker.sh — serialise every repo include + publish through one
# worker so concurrent builds never race on the published index.
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
#   aptly's `publish update` rewrites Packages/Packages.gz/Packages.bz2/Release/
#   InRelease NON-atomically into the live tree. When two uploads publish the
#   same dist near-simultaneously — or a build's pbuilder chroot runs
#   `apt-get update` mid-publish — apt sees a half-written index and aborts with
#   "File has unexpected size. Mirror sync in progress?". Per-repo flock in
#   process-incoming.sh only serialised WRITES to the same dist; it did not
#   serialise across dists, and nothing serialised the reader.
#
# THE MODEL
#   Builds drop a job dir under $QUEUE_DIR named
#       <epoch>-<pid>-<pkg>-<dist>-<arch>/
#   containing the .changes + payload, then atomically create a `.ready` marker
#   INSIDE it (the build writes <dir>/.uploading first, fills it, then renames
#   to <dir>/.ready). This worker watches $QUEUE_DIR with inotify, picks ready
#   jobs in TIMESTAMP order (the epoch prefix), and runs process-incoming.sh on
#   them ONE AT A TIME. Because a single worker processes the whole queue, every
#   include+publish is strictly serial regardless of how many builds upload at
#   once. A global flock guards against a second worker ever starting.
#
#   The worker writes the result back into the job dir so the build can poll it:
#       <dir>/.done    (exit 0; contains "0")
#       <dir>/.failed  (contains the non-zero exit code)
#   plus <dir>/worker.log with the full process-incoming output. The build
#   waits for .done/.failed and propagates the exit code, so callers still get
#   real pass/fail just like the old synchronous path. The build removes its own
#   job dir after reading the result; the worker also reaps stale dirs.
